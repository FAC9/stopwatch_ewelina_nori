# stopwatch_ewelina_nori

## Objectives
- stopwatch (start,stop,reset,laps)
- update DOM in real time
- follow the TDD approach during the development circle

### Our journey

#### Wednesday
- ping-pong pair programming
- result: stopwatch(start,stop,reset)
- Jasmine for testing

##### Discoveries
- we had to introduce a Boolean to prevent our user from clicking on the buttons straigth after each other e.g. we click on start,then click on reset before the function triggered by our start button returns.

#### Thursday
- adding lapses to the stopwatch
- switch to QUnit
- CSS styling
- refactor our code

#### Advice for future projects

- Don't use prototypes.
- Try to follow the modular approach next time.
